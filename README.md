Trust Management Delegation Mechanism - A proof-of-concept implementation of the trust management delegation protocol
This package is a proof-of-concept implementation of the trust management delegation protocol. The implementation is written in the Python language. aiocoap is leveraged to facilitate data and message transfers between entities in the proposed protocol, SQLite3 is used to store trust management and delegation information, and scikit-fuzzy for implementing trust computation models

Usage
The trust management delegation protocol requires the following libraries
- aiocoap
- SQLite3
- scikit-fuzzy
- icmplib
